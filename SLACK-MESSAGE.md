## 🎉 Database + Core Pipeline is LIVE!

Hey team! I've got the core infrastructure set up and running. Here's what's ready:

### ✅ What's Done

**Database (Supabase + Prisma)**
- All 8 models are live in production DB
- Schema at `web/prisma/schema.prisma`
- Prisma Client generated and ready to use

**Core API**
- Main endpoint: `POST /api/runs` (generates patch notes)
- Diff Engine + Patch Writer integrated and working
- Test UI at http://localhost:3000/test

**Full UI Available**
- Home page: http://localhost:3000
- Test page: http://localhost:3000/test (click button to see patch generation!)

### 🚀 Try It Yourself

```bash
cd web
npm install        # All deps are in package.json
npm run dev        # Starts on localhost:3000
```

**⚠️ Important:** You need a **valid OpenAI API key** in `.env`
- Current key is invalid
- Get one from: https://platform.openai.com/api-keys
- Or use our team's shared key (if we have one)

See `TEAM-SETUP.md` for full instructions!

### 🔌 Ready for Integration

**For Baseline Extraction Team (Phase 3):**
- Your module should output `BaselineTopic[]` format (see `prisma/schema.prisma`)
- We'll plug it into `/api/subjects/upload`

**For Senso/Apify Team (Phase 4):**
- Your module should output canon items with citations
- We'll plug it into the diff engine

### 📂 Key Files

- `web/src/app/api/runs/route.ts` - Main API endpoint (see how modules are used)
- `web/src/lib/diff-engine.ts` - Change classification
- `web/src/lib/patch-writer.ts` - Patch notes generation
- `web/prisma/schema.prisma` - Database schema
- `TEAM-SETUP.md` - Complete setup guide
- `STATUS.md` - Project status and roadmap

### 🎯 What's Next?

Once you've played with the test UI, we need to:
1. Get a valid OpenAI API key (team decision?)
2. Integrate your modules (Phase 3 & 4)
3. Build out the subject management UI
4. Add PDF upload functionality
