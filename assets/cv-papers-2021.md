## 2. Decoding in the presence of ISI without interleaving ORBGRAND AI

- **ArXiv ID**: 2510.14939
- **Published**: 2025-10-16
- **Year**: 2025

**Abstract**: Inter symbol interference (ISI), which occurs in a wide variety of channels, is a result of time dispersion. It can be mitigated by equalization which results in noise coloring. For such colored noise, we propose a decoder called Ordered Reliability Bit Guessing Random Additive Noise Decoding (ORBGRANDAI) which is inspired by the development of approximate independence in statistical physics. By f...

## 6. Learning When Not to Learn: Risk-Sensitive Abstention in Bandits with Unbounded Rewards

- **ArXiv ID**: 2510.14884
- **Published**: 2025-10-16
- **Year**: 2025
- **Authors**: Sarah Liaw, Benjamin Plaut

- **Links**: [ArXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14884) | [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.14884.pdf)

**Abstract**: In high-stakes AI applications, even a single action can cause irreparable damage. However, nearly all of sequential decision-making theory assumes that all errors are recoverable (e.g., by bounding rewards). Standard bandit algorithms that explore aggressively may cause irreparable damage when this assumption fails. Some prior work avoids irreparable errors by asking for help from a mentor, but a...

- **Links**: [ArXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14846) | [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.14846.pdf)

**Abstract**: The generate-filter-refine (iterative paradigm) based on large language models (LLMs) has achieved progress in reasoning, programming, and program discovery in AI+Science. However, the effectiveness of search depends on where to search, namely, how to encode the domain prior into an operationally structured hypothesis space. To this end, this paper proposes a compact formal theory that describes a...

- **Categories**: cs.CV
- **Links**: [ArXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14831) | [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.14831.pdf)

**Abstract**: AI for tumor segmentation is limited by the lack of large, voxel-wise annotated datasets, which are hard to create and require medical experts. In our proprietary JHH dataset of 3,000 annotated pancreatic tumor scans, we found that AI performance stopped improving after 1,500 scans. With synthetic data, we reached the same performance using only 500 real scans. This finding suggests that synthetic...

**Abstract**: We introduce NAEL (Non-Anthropocentric Ethical Logic), a novel ethical framework for artificial agents grounded in active inference and symbolic reasoning. Departing from conventional, human-centred approaches to AI ethics, NAEL formalizes ethical behaviour as an emergent property of intelligent systems minimizing global expected free energy in dynamic, multi-agent environments. We propose a neuro...

## 20. Beyond Hallucinations: The Illusion of Understanding in Large Language Models

- **ArXiv ID**: 2510.14665
- **Published**: 2025-10-16
- **Year**: 2025

- **Links**: [ArXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14665) | [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.14665.pdf)

**Abstract**: Large language models (LLMs) are becoming deeply embedded in human communication and decision-making, yet they inherit the ambiguity, bias, and lack of direct access to truth inherent in language itself. While their outputs are fluent, emotionally resonant, and coherent, they are generated through statistical prediction rather than grounded reasoning. This creates the risk of hallucination, respon...

**Abstract**: Text-To-Speech synthesis has achieved near-human quality in neutral speech, but emotional expressiveness remains a challenge. Existing methods often rely on costly emotion annotations or optimize indirect objectives that fail to capture the emotional expressiveness and perceptual naturalness of speech, leading to generated speech that is accurate but emotionally flat. To address these challenges, ...

**Abstract**: Large language models promise a broad set of functions, but when not given a specific objective, they default to milquetoast results such as drafting emails littered with cliches. We demonstrate that inferring the user's in-the-moment objective, then rapidly optimizing for that singular objective, enables LLMs to produce tools, interfaces, and responses that are more responsive and desired. We con...

**Abstract**: Obtaining high-quality labels for large datasets is expensive, requiring massive annotations from human experts. While AI models offer a cost-effective alternative by predicting labels, their label quality is compromised by the unavoidable labeling errors. Existing methods mitigate this issue through selective labeling, where AI labels a subset and human labels the remainder. However, these method...
