Requirements
Challenge: Build autonomous, self-improving AI agents that can tap into real-time data sources, make sense of what they find, and take meaningful action without human intervention. Your challenge is to design agents that are not just reactive, but continuously learn and  improve as they operate—creating solutions that feel alive, adaptive, and built for real-world impact.
